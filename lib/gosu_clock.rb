module Rubygame
		#  Clock provides class methods for tracking running time and delaying
		#  execution of the program for specified time periods. This is used to
		#  provide a consistent framerate, prevent the program from using
		#  all the processor time, etc.
		# 
		#  Clock also provides instance methods to make it convenient to
		#  monitor and limit application framerate. See #tick.

			# You must call this method once per frame (i.e. per iteration of
			# your main loop) if you want to use the framerate monitoring and/or
			# framerate limiting features.
			# 
			# Framerate monitoring allows you to check the framerate (frames per
			# second) with the #framerate method.
			# 
			# Framerate limiting allows you to prevent the application from running
			# too fast (and using 100% of processor time) by pausing the program
			# very briefly each frame. The pause duration is calculated each frame
			# to maintain a constant framerate.
			# 
			# Framerate limiting is only enabled if you have set the
			# #target_framerate= or #target_frametime=.
			# If you have done that, this method will automatically perform the
			# delay each time you call it.
			# 
			# (Please note that no effort is made to correct a framerate
			# which is *slower* than the target framerate. Clock can't
			# make your code run faster, only slow it down if it is
			# running too fast.)
